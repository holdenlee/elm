
To add:

+ Spawn
+ Make it easy to get other actors (ex. getActorInDir), be able to filter actors
+ Incorporate randomness
+ Add sounds
+ Add reactions

To fix:
+ Bug with (.|) combinator
+ Implement a better way to pass success/failure (at world rather than actor level)

To add, unclear what's the best way:

+ Add to/remove from active list
+ Make it more convenient to display actors spanning multiple blocks
