Ready to play:

+ ddr2.elm
+ TugOWar.elm
+ snake.elm

For testing purposes:

+ Keys.elm (shows keys pressed)
+ GameOptions.elm (how to create a game menu)

I'm building a 2D game platform. I need to update it to the latest version of Elm (as of now, it won't compile).

To add:

+ Spawn
+ Make it easy to get other actors (ex. getActorInDir), be able to filter actors
+ Incorporate randomness
+ Add sounds
+ Add reactions

To fix:
+ Bug with (.|) combinator
+ Implement a better way to pass success/failure (at world rather than actor level)

To add, unclear what's the best way:

+ Add to/remove from active list
+ Make it more convenient to display actors spanning multiple blocks
